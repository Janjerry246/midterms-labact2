<body background="bg.jpg" >

<p>Information technology is the study, design, development, implementation, support or management of computer-based information systems—particularly software applications and computer hardware. IT workers help ensure that computers work well for people.

    Nearly every company, from a software design firm, to the biggest manufacturer, to the smallest “mom & pop” store, needs information technology workers to keep their businesses running smoothly, according to industry experts.
    
    Most information technology jobs fall into four broad categories: computer scientists, computer engineers, systems analysts and computer programmers. HR managers responsible for recruiting IT employees increasingly must become familiar with the function and titles of the myriad job titles in demand today.<p>
    
    Some of them are listed below:
    
    <ul>
    <li>Administration associate</li> 
    <li>Systems operator/analyst</li> 
    <li>Interactive digital media specialist</li>
    <li>Network specialist</li>
    <li>Programmer/analyst</li>
    <li>Software engineer</li>
    <li>Technical support representative</li></ul>

        <li >Computer scientists <br>
        - A computer scientist is a person who has acquired the knowledge of computer science, the study of the theoretical foundations of information and computation and their application.

        Computer scientists typically work on the theoretical side of computer systems, as opposed to the hardware side on which computer engineers mainly focus (although there is overlap). Although computer scientists can also focus their work and research on specific areas (such as algorithm and data structure development and design, software engineering, information theory, database theory, computational complexity theory, numerical analysis, programming language theory, computer graphics, and computer vision), their foundation is the theoretical study of computing from which these other fields derive.
        
        A primary goal of computer scientists is to develop or validate models, often mathematical, to describe the properties of computer-based systems (processors, programs, computers interacting with people, computers interacting with other computers, etc.) with an overall objective of discovering designs that yield useful benefits (faster, smaller, cheaper, more precise, etc.).</li>
        <li>Computer Engineers <br>
            Computer engineers embed computers in other machines and systems, build networks to transfer data, and develop ways to make computers, faster, smaller, and more capable. Computer engineers are improving the ability of computers to "see" and "think." They are making computers more mobile, and even incorporating computers into fabrics, clothes, and building materials.</li>
        <li>Systems Analysts <br>
            A systems analyst is a person who uses analysis and design techniques to solve business problems using information technology. Systems analysts may serve as change agents who identify the organizational improvements needed, design systems to implement those changes, and train and motivate others to use the systems.</li>
        <li>Computer Programmer <br>
            Computer programmers provide valuable services across economic sectors, creating code for software and computer applications and programs. These professionals work in information technology, academia, government service, and medical fields — with additional career opportunities as independent and contract workers.</li>
        <li>HR Managers <br>
            Human resource (HR) managers are involved with recruitment, training, career development, compensation and benefits, employee relations, industrial relations, employment law, compliance, disciplinary and grievance issues, redundancies etc.</li>
        <li>Network Specialist <br>
            Network Specialists manage networks to ensure they function efficiently. Tasks such as collecting network performance data, monitoring network security, troubleshooting issues, anticipating problems and performing routine maintenance are commonplace for these IT professionals.</li>
        <li>Software Engineer <br>
        Software engineers are computer science professionals who use knowledge of engineering principles and programming languages to build software products, develop computer games, and run network control systems.</li>
        <li>Software <br>
            the programs and other operating information used by a computer.</li>
        <li>Computer hardware <br>
            Computer hardware includes the physical parts of a computer, such as the case central processing unit (CPU), monitor, mouse, keyboard, computer data storage, graphics card, sound card, speakers and motherboard.

            By contrast, software is the set of instructions that can be stored and run by hardware. Hardware is so-termed because it is "hard" or rigid with respect to changes, whereas software is "soft" because it is easy to change.</li>
        <li>Administration associate <br>
            Administrative associates perform administrative tasks at companies. The role bears similarity to an administrative assistant position but at a higher level. Administrative associates generally spend less time on secretarial duties and instead focus more on departmental operation.</li>
